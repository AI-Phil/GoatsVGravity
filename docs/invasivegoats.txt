Effects of Invasive Goats (Capra hircus) on Mediterranean Island Communities 
Although islands exhibit great biodiversity, a high rate of endemism and simplified food webs make them highly susceptible to disturbances such as invasive species. Introduced feral goats (Capra hircus), a generalist herbivore, are among the most important invasive species on  islands. Many endemic island plants have evolved without intense grazing pressure and have developed few to no defenses against herbivory. Concern about the effects of goats on island communities has led to increasing numbers of goat eradication programs. Unintended consequences may follow eradications because goat grazing can have complex, community-wide  effects on island food webs. We evaluated the long-term effects of goat herbivory and goat removal in a system of 16 islands in the Aegean Sea (Greece) located within the globally  important Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot. In this region, goats have always been an integral part of rural economies. The seasonal introduction of goats onto small Aegean islands is of special conservation concern because these islands are inhabited by particular plant communities  that have evolved in the absence of herbivory. Our data suggest that goats change plant community assemblages: they significantly decreased the height, percent cover, and biomass of  vegetation on an island. Additionally, goats significantly contribute to the desertification of islands by initiating a long-term erosion cycle that delays recovery even once goats have been  removed. In contrast, arthropods, important primary consumers, do not appear to be affected by goat removal as any advantages obtained in absence of goats appear to benefit higher trophic  levels. This study also reaffirms the role of seabirds in providing valuable N and P marine subsidies to terrestrial food webs of Mediterranean islets. These findings demonstrate that goats have serious, long-lasting effects on small island ecosystems and that additional remediation  steps are needed following goat removal.
One of the greatest threats to biodiversity is the worldwide spread of invasive species (Hooper et al. 2012). Both intentional and accidental introductions of exotic species have increased exponentially over the years and have radically reshaped native communities (Kolar &  Lodge 2001). Myers et al. (2000) argue that at least 9 of the 25 proposed biodiversity hotspots consist entirely or principally of islands, highlighting their importance for global biodiversity.  Islands host over 20% of the world’s biodiversity despite only being roughly 5% of the global terrestrial area (Kier et al. 2009). Exotic species introductions have the most profound effects on isolated islands, especially those supporting unique biotic communities rich in endemic taxa  (Mueller-Dombois 1981). Island ecosystems are highly susceptible to disturbances because they tend to have simplified trophic webs and high rates of endemism (Courchamp et al. 2003).  Insular populations are more susceptible to extinction than mainland species (MacArthur & Wilson 1967; Foufopoulos et al. 2011). Reflecting their susceptibility, 90% of the 30 reported reptile and amphibian extinctions (Honegger 1981), 93% of the 176 documented avian  extinctions (King 1985), and 81% of the 65 observed mammalian extinctions worldwide have  occurred on islands (Ceballos & Brown 1995). Half of the documented extinctions of Mediterranean island endemic species have occurred on small islands (Greuter 1995).  Many of the most detrimental island invasives are human associates, such as invasive rats (Rattus spp.),  feral cats (Felis catus), rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), and escaped livestock (Jones et al. 2008;  Nogales et al. 2004; Bowen & Van Vuren 1997). More specifically, introduced feral livestock, such as pigs (Sus scrofa), sheep (Ovis aries), and goats (Capra hircus), tend to overgraze and  damage island landscapes, causing soil erosion, devastating the native plant communities, and  removing primary producers from island food webs (Coblentz 1978).    
A key factor in the proliferation of introduced mammalian herbivores on islands is the vegetation’s lack of defenses. Most plants have some sort of defense against herbivory (Marquis 1991) the extent of which is often proportional to the risk of browsing (Rhoades 1979). Until the arrival of humans, mammalian herbivores were absent from most small island ecosystems  (Atkinson 1989). Due to the energetic costs of resistance in plants, species that have evolved on islands in the absence of grazing pressure often lack defenses against herbivory such as chemical  deterrents, physical weapons, or a tolerance to grazing (Carlquist 1974; Coblentz 1978; Vitousek  1988). The lack of resistance traits can lead to strong shifts in the diet preferences of herbivores towards the less defended endemic flora, giving more heavily defended invasive plants a  competitive advantage (Loope & Scowcroft 1985; Van Vuren & Coblentz 1987; Merlin & Juvik  1992). On New Zealand, Atkinson (2001) discovered that some of the native plants did have defenses against herbivory believed to be caused by associations with the extinct moa, a large  flightless ratite. However, these defenses were only partially effective against introduced mammalian herbivores (Atkinson & Greenwood 1989). In the Mediterranean, plant species vary greatly in their levels of phenols; preferential grazing occurred on species with the lowest  phenolic levels (Massei et al. 2000).
Today, goats are recognized as the sixth leading threat to vertebrate species worldwide (Bellard et al. 2016). In the early 20th century, Sir Alfred Russell Wallace noticed that, “goats are the greatest of all foes to trees” (Wallace 1911). Domesticated in the dry highlands of western Iran 10,000 years ago (Zeder & Hesse 2000), goats are able to utilize many arid habitats unsuitable for other herbivores. This adaptability arises from the combination of their slow metabolism, efficient digestive system, low water requirements, high reproduction rates, and a generalist diet (Silanikove 2000). Goats also have the ability to consume tougher, chemically-defended food, making more vegetation available to them (Devendra & McLeroy 1982).  
Relatively few studies have been conducted to confirm quantitatively the effects of goat grazing on vegetation cover and species richness. Mueller-Dombois & Spatz (1972) found in Hawaii that areas where goats were excluded showed an increase in vegetation cover. Further, outside the goat exclosures, there were fewer endemic species, more exotic species, and much more barren soil and rock. Spatz & Mueller-Dombois (1973) found that the regeneration of the Hawaiian endemic koa tree (Acacia koa), was interrupted in areas of grazing but abundant in goat exclosures. In the Galápagos, goats have reduced or eliminated 77% of all plant species on the islands (Eckhardt 1972), and compete with the native herbivore, the Galápagos tortoise (MacFarland et al. 1974). Consequently, the decline of primary producers on islands with goat grazing constitutes a severe problem and requires better understanding and management. Invasive goat numbers have been found in some studies to be negatively correlated with seabird populations (e.g., Pafilis et al. 2013). Islands constitute relatively closed terrestrial systems where local seabird populations provide critically important allochthonous marine nutrient subsidies to the simple local food webs (Sánchez-Piñero & Polis 2000). Seabirds leave guano, food scraps, and carrion on roosting and nesting sites. All of these serve as fertilizers for plants, which in turn can boost arthropod and other primary consumer populations (Sánchez-Piñero & Polis 2000). Indeed, nesting seabirds have been found to increase the limiting soil nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) (Wait et al. 2005), which in turn support dense insular primary producer populations (Kolb et al. 2010). Thus, one aim of this study was to investigate whether presence of goats is associated with decreased nesting seabird populations. Given the importance of seabirds for nutrient cycling in island systems, any factor that reduces their numbers can have impacts that go well beyond any immediate effects.  
Driven by the perceived negative influences of feral goats on island ecosystems, conservation organizations have attempted to eradicate goats from numerous island sites worldwide – but with highly variable success. Failures can often be traced to a lack of quality demographic data on goat population size and ecology. To date, there have been over 120 eradications worldwide that succeeded thanks to advances in technology and improved field techniques. In recent years, eradication campaigns have been successful on increasingly larger islands. In part, success is due to new approaches: Global Positioning Systems (GPS), aerial hunting, as well as Judas goat methods (which take advantage of the gregarious lifestyles of goats to lure out all individuals; Campbell & Donlan 2005). Results of these eradications can be difficult to predict – the ecosystem may recover on its own, require some restoration or reintroduction, or become even more damaged due to ecological destabilization (Courchamp et al. 2003). Very few studies have implemented monitoring programs to evaluate the recovery of these systems after eradication. Of the few eradication studies completed, vegetation responses have varied based on region, habitat, and vegetation type, suggesting island-specific responses (Schweizer et al. 2016). Therefore, predicting the success of eradication attempts can be difficult.  
Successful goat eradications can create surprising and unintended conservation problems. Adequate assessments of the consequences of eradication are hindered because ecological relationships among island organisms are often poorly understood prior to eradication (Zavaleta et al. 2001). For example, goat eradications on the Galápagos Islands led to a decline, rather than a recovery, of the endangered Galápagos Hawk (Buteo galapagoensis), because the species had come to depend on goat-altered habitats (Rivera-Parra et al. 2012). With declining Galápagos tortoise (Geochelone elephantopus) populations and goat eradications, the lack of herbivores on Pinta Island actually led to a decline in vegetation diversity through homogenization of the landscape (Hamann 1993). Similarly, on the Bonin Islands, unbeknownst to conservation managers, goat grazing kept newly arrived invasive plants under control. Once the goats were eradicated, these exotic plants overran the landscape, devastating the native plant communities (Mack & Lonsdale 2002). Roxburgh et al. (2004) discuss the “intermediate disturbance” hypothesis: the highest levels of biodiversity are attained with intermediate levels of disturbance e.g., fire, natural disasters, and grazing. Up to a point, grazing could allow less competitive, early successional species to coexist in the presence of stronger competitors (Hobbs & Huenneke 1992). In the Mediterranean, foraging by goats has been an important source of landscape heterogeneity, which allows for a mosaic of diverse habitats (San Miguel-Ayanz et al. 2010; Gabay et al. 2008). The ecological role of grazing has been so extensive, that many habitats are maintained by extensive livestock management systems (San Miguel-Ayanz et al. 2010). As a result, it has become obvious to the conservation community that in order to prevent unintended consequences of eradications, it is critical to understand the effects and life history traits of invasive goats before any eradication efforts are contemplated (Zavaleta et al. 2001).  
In the Mediterranean, goat meat, milk, and cheese have always been an integral part of island economies (Hadjigeorgiou et al. 2002); most inhabited islands are grazed year-round by roving herds of goats. With the increased availability of boat motors and the reliability of access, shepherds have expanded their grazing area to relatively small but ecologically important islets. Typically, Mediterranean shepherds will release herds of goats onto such islands after the onset of the growing season, coming back to collect them after they feed on the spring vegetation flush. Such free-ranging goat herds will typically graze with limited, if any, supplemental feeding (Pafilis et al. 2013). Because islands are generally overstocked, even seasonal presence can have severe impacts on local plant communities.  However, in the last 20 years, because of policy changes and a shift away from traditional livestock husbandry, seasonal goat releases have been discontinued on several islands. This sets the stage for an investigation of the potential recovery of local ecosystems after goats have been removed. 
In contrast to most studies that focus on exclosure plots, we test for effects on an island-wide scale (Greuter 1995). Islands represent spatially discrete entities making them reliable study systems. We examine effects on multiple trophic levels and their interactions. In particular, we quantify soil characteristics, vegetation characteristics, arthropod characteristics, and seabird populations on each island and combine these variables to elucidate the community-wide effects of grazing by goats.  
Study Area. All fieldwork occurred in May-July 2015 on the Cycladic islands (central Aegean Sea, Greece). The climate is typical of the Mediterranean region with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters (Gikas & Tchobanoglous 2009). Less than 14% of the precipitation in the Aegean Islands percolates into the ground, whereas 55% of the precipitation evaporates, and 33% runs off into the sea (Gikas & Tchobanoglous 2009). The islands are mainly composed of limestone and flysch substrates with shallow to no soil profiles. Located within the Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot, they represent a hyperdiverse landscape of many endemic, mainly semiarid phrygana and maquis vegetation types (Médail & Quézel 1999; Vogiatzakis & Griffiths 2008). The vegetation is mainly arid-adapted, sclerophyllous scrub. “Islet specialist” plant species – taxa found only on small islands – play a major role in the ecosystems of the very small islands of the Aegean (Bergmeier & Dimopoulos 2003). All of the study islets have relatively simple food webs in which the top predators are lizards (Podarcis erhardii, Hemidactylus turcicus, and Mediodactylus kotschyi). Snakes (Eryx jaculus) are present only on the two largest islands in this study (Drionissi and Gramvoussa). All of our study islands are uninhabited and fall into one of three categories: islands currently being grazed by goats (Aspronissi, Fidussa, Agrilou, and Venetiko); islands which have never been grazed by goats (Turlos, Preza, Agia Kali, Drionissi, Grambonissi, North Varvaronissi, and South Varvaronissi); and those with recent goat removals (Mikros Ambelas, Petalidi, Kisiri, Psalida, and Gramvoussa) (Figure 1). Goats are kept on the islands on a seasonal basis (February-late May) coincident with the spring vegetation flush; they are removed before the onset of the long, dry summer season when the islands do not provide enough resources to support larger herbivores. We considered an island to be grazed if goats had been brought onto the island for more than one spring season. Because islands are relatively small, and the habitat open, we were able to census goats visually. From interviews with local shepherds, we determined that all islands considered eradicated have been devoid of goats for at least 10 years. 
Soil Analysis. Five roughly 1kg soil samples were collected from each island. Samples were gathered from the four cardinal directions to minimize the effects of aspect on soil characteristics. Samples were kept in a freezer and transported to D. Hatzinikolaou at the University of Athens and P. Avramidis at the University of Patras, for analysis of chemical content and texture. Grain size distribution was made using a Malvern Mastersizer 2000. Moment measures were calculated using GRADISTAT V.4 software (Blott & Pye 2001) and based on Folk (1974) nomenclature. For total carbon (C) and total N, we used a Carlo Erba EA1108 CHNS-O Elemental analyzer. Total organic C content was estimated using the titration method according to Gaudette & Flight (1974). We divided the total C by total N to determine a C:N ratio. The ratio of C to N is a crucial measurement for decomposition (Parnas 1975). In addition, organic matter is an important aspect of erosion susceptibility because it acts as a glue to hold soil particles together. Since organic matter is roughly 58% C, the average percent of organic C was multiplied by 1.72 (Nelson & Sommers 1982). We calculated total P based on a persulfate digestion method according to APHA 4500-P (2005). CaCO3 was measured using a digital hand-held soil calcimeter (FOGII/Version 2/2014; BD INVENTIONS). More specifically, CaCO3 (%) calculation was based on the measurement of emitted CO2, a method modified from Müller & Gastner (1971). To determine the degree of erosion, soil depth measurements were taken from 30 random locations on each island using a graded metal bar that was sunk into the ground until it encountered bedrock; values were averaged to obtain an island wide value of soil depth.  
Quantification of Vegetation Condition. To asses vegetation characteristics we established four 50m transects, one in each cardinal direction, on most study islands. On the smallest islands (Kisiri, Mikros Ambelas, and North Varvaronissi) that could not accommodate this design, fewer transects were used. We continuously measured each area of vegetation along the entire length of each transect and averaged the values. The average percent vegetation cover for each island was recorded. We also applied this method to assess percent bedrock and bare soil. To determine vegetation height, we measured the height of plants every 2m along each transect and averaged the values for each island. We sampled vegetation biomass in five randomly placed 80cm x 80cm quadrat squares around the island. In these samples, all vegetation was clipped to ground level; all plant matter within the quadrat was collected and sun-dried until no further weight losses were observed, and then weighed. For each island, all aboveground biomass data were averaged and expressed as a single g/m2 value. Plant species communities were determined from ten 80cm x 80cm quadrat squares that were placed every 5m along each established transect; in each quadrat we recorded the identity of all plants (Lafranchis & Sfikas 2009). Utilizing the program EstimateS (Colwell 2013), we generated a sample-based incidence rarefaction curve (Gotelli & Colwell 2001; Colwell et al. 2004). A bias-corrected form of the Chao2 asymptotic estimator was used to estimate the actual number of plant species on the island (Chao 1987; Colwell & Coddington 1994, Gotelli & Colwell 2011):  where SChao2 = the estimated number of species, Sobs = the observed number of species, m = the total number of samples, q1 = the number of unique species, and q2 = the number of duplicate species (for examples of rarefaction curves see Appendix 2).  
It is necessary to correct for area effects when making inter-island comparisons because the number of species increases with island size (MacArthur & Wilson 1967). This species-area relationship can be defined by the power law S = CAz, where C and z are coefficients and A is the area. To estimate species density C (an area-independent metric of species richness given by the equation C = S/Az), we obtained a data-based estimate of the coefficient z by plotting the species-area relationship for our study system and extracting the exponent of the fitted curve (Rosenzweig et al. 2011). To quantify species diversity, we used a Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index that was developed to take into account both species richness and evenness (Maurer & McGill 2011). Evenness metrics examine how abundance is apportioned among species. 𝐷𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑛���𝑛 = − ∑ 𝑝𝑖ln (𝑝𝑖) where pi is the proportion of abundance for species i. 
Quantification of Arthropod Characteristics. Five pitfall traps, used to sample epigeal arthropods, were installed on each island at randomly chosen locations near each directional transect. The traps were constructed by sinking plastic cups (7cm in diameter and 11cm deep), filled 2/3 with ethylene glycol, flush into the ground. The ethylene glycol was used because of its dual properties as a preservative and its high evaporation point (Schmidt et al. 2006). Traps were placed under a large, elevated flat stone in a fashion that protected them from livestock trampling but would still allow free access to invertebrates. After approximately 2 weeks (on average 17.19 ± 4.59 days), the samples were collected, identified to morphospecies, counted, dried, and weighed.  Abundance of each species and total number of observed species were recorded for each island. The program EstimateS (Colwell 2013) was used to construct a sample-based abundance rarefaction curve for each island (Gotelli & Colwell 2001; Colwell et al. 2004). A bias-corrected form of the Chao1 asymptotic estimator was used to estimate the total number of arthropod species on the island (Chao 1987; Colwell & Coddington 1994, Gotelli & Colwell 2011):  𝑆𝐶ℎ𝑎𝑛���1 = 𝑆𝑛���𝑎���𝑠 + 𝑓1(𝑓1 − 1)2(𝑓2 + 1) where SChao1 = the number of estimated species, Sobs = the observed number of species, f1 = the number of singleton species, and f2 = the number of doubleton species (for examples of rarefaction curves see Appendix 3). Since the number of species is intrinsically linked to the size of an island (MacArthur & Wilson 1967), area was accounted for using the coefficient C of the species-area relationship, where C = S/Az (Rosenzweig et al. 2011) in order to get a comparable measurement. We used a Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index to take into account both species richness and evenness (Maurer & McGill 2011).  𝐷𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑛𝑛���𝑛 = − ∑ 𝑝𝑖ln (𝑝𝑖) where pi is the proportion of abundance for species i. The number of arthropod individuals was counted for each trap and then averaged for each island and divided by the number of days left out for collection. Each sample was dried under a heat lamp until no further weight reductions were observed and then the weight was recorded. Arthropod biomass was averaged for each island and divided by the number of days collected. 
Quantification of Seabird Populations. Populations of nesting seabirds were determined over the course of several visits to each island during the bird nesting season. Animals were counted using binoculars by two independent observers and repeated until within 10% of each other. The values were then averaged and divided by island area to calculate seabird density (birds/km2). 
Statistical Analysis. We utilized Shapiro-Wilkes tests to test for normality; variables that failed to meet the normality assumption were either natural log transformed (arthropod biomass, number of arthropods, C:N), square root transformed (seabird density), or arcsine-square root transformed (% CaCO3, % N, % Arachnida, and % Diptera). We compared all observed variables across the three island types – no goats, goats, and goats removed. We ran one-way ANOVA tests followed by post-hoc Tukey tests to examine if there were significant differences between the means for each variable. If normality criteria could not be met, we used Kruskal-Wallis tests instead. We also compared the observed variables using linear regressions to test for correlations. If normality assumptions could not be met, generalized linear models were used instead. All analyses were run in RStudio (RStudio Team 2015). 
Effects of Goats. Herbivory by goats has strong and significant effects on island plant communities. We identified 119 unique plant species from the 16 study islands (Appendices 1, 5). Grazing status of an island significantly affects the estimated plant species density (p=0.00676, F=7.521, n=16, ANOVA). Islands with removed goats have significantly fewer species relative to both grazed and ungrazed islands; they have lost 46.4% of their estimated taxa numbers compared to ungrazed islands (Figure 2). The Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index for plants (p=0.00412, F=8.628, n=16, ANOVA) follows a similar pattern: islands with removed goats have significantly lower SWDI values relative to ungrazed islands. Percent vegetation cover declines significantly (p=0.004, F=8.438, n=16, ANOVA) in both grazed (25.96%) and goat-removed (38.56%) islands relative to the ungrazed sample. Plant biomass also declines significantly (p=0.00267, F=9.679, n=16, ANOVA), with grazed islands experiencing an average of 66.4% loss in average vegetation biomass (Figure 3). Mean plant height (p=0.013, F=6.174, n=16, ANOVA) is on average 63.64% shorter on grazed islands and 64.85% shorter on goat-removed islands relative to ungrazed islands.  
Grazing also is significantly associated with erosion as evidenced by an average increase of 82.45% in the amount of exposed bedrock (p=0.0158, F=5.804, n=16, ANOVA) and an average decrease of 44.41% of average soil depth (p=0.000983, F=12.36, n=16, ANOVA) (Figure 4) on grazed relative to ungrazed islands. More importantly, this process of soil loss continued even after goats had been removed, resulting in a 146.07% increase in average percent rock and a 68.31% decrease in average soil depth on islands with removed goats as compared to ungrazed islands (see Figure 5).  
While grazing by goats was associated with declining amounts of soil, we found little evidence for effects on soil structure or chemistry. Grazing status does not significantly affect average % bare ground (p=0.525, F=0.678, n=16, ANOVA), average % organic matter (p=0.591, F=0.549, n=16, ANOVA), average % CaCO3 (p=0.548, F=0.63, n=16, ANOVA), average % N (p=0.686, F=0.388, n=16, ANOVA), average % P (p=0.954, X2=0.0947, n=16, Kruskal-Wallis), C:N ratio (p=0.836, F=0.182, n=16, ANOVA), average % sand (p=0.757, F=0.285, n=16, ANOVA), average % silt (p=0.762, X2=0.545, n=16, Kruskal-Wallis), or average % clay (p=0.464, F=0.814, n=16, ANOVA).  
We do document a marginally significant effect of goats on the arthropod Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index (p=0.064, F=3.417, n=16, ANOVA). Grazing status does not significantly affect estimated arthropod species density (p=0.489, F=0.757, n=16, ANOVA), average arthropod biomass/trap/day (p=0.611, F=0.511, n=16, ANOVA), or average number of arthropods/trap/day (p=0.561, F=0.604, n=16, ANOVA). Within separate arthropod taxa, only % dipterans is significantly affected by grazing (p=0.049, F=3.98, n=16, ANOVA) where we see a 109.25% increase in areas with goats compared to ungrazed islands. Grazing has a marginally significant effect on % hymenopterans (p=0.063, F=3.442, n=16, ANOVA) where goats result in a 53.2% decrease relative to ungrazed islands. The percentage of arachnids (p=0.557, F=0.613, n=16, ANOVA), coleopterans (p=0.146, F=2.235, n=16, ANOVA), isopods (p=0.281, X2=2.541, n=16, Kruskal-Wallis), and hemipterans (p=0.92, X2=0.167, n=16, Kruskal-Wallis) are not affected by grazing. Grazing also does not seem to affect seabird densities on islands (p=0.154, F=2.168, n=16, ANOVA). See Appendix 4 for more graphs.  
Impacts of Soil Erosion. The erosion caused by goats has significant implications for vegetation characteristics. With the increased exposed rock that comes with goat grazing, there is on average significantly less plant biomass (p=0.033, t=-2.373, n=16, linear regression), less average percent vegetation cover (p<0.00001, t=-8.157, n=16, linear regression), and shorter average plant height (p=0.00059, t=-4.416, n=16, linear regression). Unexpectedly, we document a significant positive relationship between amounts of exposed bedrock and the Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index for arthropods (p=0.033, t=2.361, n=16, linear regression).  Similarly, soil depth is positively associated with vegetation cover (p=0.0034, t=3.524, n=16, linear regression) and average vegetation height (p=0.01, t=2.975, n=16, linear regression). Higher soil P and lower C:N ratios are positively correlated with the estimated arthropod species density (p=0.013, t=2.826, n=16, generalized linear model & p=0.046, t=-2.190, n=16, linear regression, respectively). Lastly, we document a marginally significant relationship between N content and average plant heights (p=0.056, t=2.107, n=16, linear regression) as well as P content and plant Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index (p=0.086, t=-1.844, n=16, generalized linear model).
Vegetation Effects on Arthropods. We collected a total of 7,054 individuals from 118 arthropod taxa. Hymenoptera (particularly ants), Isopoda, Coleoptera, and Arachnida were the most abundant taxa collectively comprising 84.2% of the collected arthropods (Hymenoptera 29.2%; Isopoda 24.3%; Coleoptera 22.7%; Arachnida 8%). A significant inverse relationship was found between arthropod Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index and average % vegetation cover (p=0.049, t=-2.145, n=16, linear regression). Marginally significant relationships were found between increasing average arthropod biomass/trap/day and increasing estimated plant species density (p=0.076, t=1.917, n=16, linear regression), as well as negatively between arthropod Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index and both average plant height (p=0.061, t=-2.04, n=16, linear regression) and average vegetation biomass (p=0.089, t=-1.826, n=16, linear regression). 
Seabird Effects. The main seabird species on the study sites were the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis) and European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), which nest on the islands. The density of these seabirds is associated with significantly increased levels of N (p=0.0035, t=3.502, n=16, linear regression) and P (p=0.00155, t=3.915, n=16, generalized linear model) in the soil presumably representing marine subsidies (Figures 6 & 7). A marginally-significant negative relationship was found between seabird densities and the vegetation Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index (p=0.0617, t=-2.031, n=16, linear regression). No significant relationships were detected between seabird densities and estimated plant species density (p= 0.754, t=-0.32, n=16, linear regression), average % vegetation cover (p=0.494, t=0.702, n=16, linear regression), average vegetation biomass (p=0.264, t=1.164, n=16, linear regression), average plant height (p=0.2125, t=1.306, n=16, linear regression), average soil depth (p=0.345, t=0.977, n=16, linear regression), average % organic matter (p=0.248, t=1.206, n=16, linear regression), average % CaCO3 (p=0.184, t=-1.396, n=16, linear regression), C:N ratio (p=0.183, t=-1.4, n=16, linear regression), estimated arthropod species density (p=0.335, t=0.999, n=16, linear regression), arthropod Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index (p=0.937, t=0.081, n=16, linear regression), average arthropod biomass/trap/day (p=0.696, t=-0.398, n=16, linear regression), or average number of arthropods/trap/day (p=0.56, t=0.596, n=16, linear regression). 
Effects on Vegetation. The presence of goats on an island has a significant effect on that island’s vegetation, and has implications for conservation programs. Our results indicate that goat grazing regimes set in motion a positive feedback loop of desertification on islands. Trampling of the soil and removal of vegetation dislodges and triggers soil movement which continues even after goats have been removed. The loss of soil combined with goat grazing lead to reduced plant cover, less plant biomass, and overall shorter plants. Once goats are removed from islands, some of the plant biomass returns to the island but remains restricted to the small pockets of soil persisting in rock depressions. 
Bayne et al. (2004) saw a similar trend in Australia analyzing sediment fluxes in areas with varying grazing intensities and found that there was less vegetation in areas with more goats, which rendered the soil more susceptible to erosion and subsequently increased the risk of further plant loss. Overgrazing in tandem with trampling and compaction of soil and loss of vegetation, has the ability to even change the hydrology of ecosystems and increase stream flows through reduced infiltration and increased surface runoff (Van Vuren et al. 2001).  
Despite these reductions in plant presence, we did not document a significant change in the estimated plant species density and the Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index between islands with and without goat grazing. Nonetheless, there were important differences in plant community composition. While plant assemblages on islands without goats are characterized by native, undefended species such as Medicago arborea, Matthiola sinuata, and Atriplex halimus, islands with goats are characterized by more generalist, low-lying plant species, usually with sticky seeds such as Plantago coronopus, Tordylium apulum, and Phleum arenarium. Panitsa et al. (2006) suggested that the increase in plant species associated with goat grazing can be traced to the introduction of seeds in the fur or feces of an animal. Snogerup & Snogerup (2004) classified roughly 100 taxa that were probably transported by grazing animals. Disturbances can be associated with higher levels of alpha diversity due to introductions of invasive species (Hobbs & Huenneke 1992). High grazing pressure can actually increase plant species richness in nutrient-rich ecosystems, such as islands where seabirds nest (Proulx & Mazumder 1998). Our observations suggest that once goats are removed from an island, the island begins to lose some of these weedier species, while the native species do not return, resulting in an overall decline in alpha diversity. Depending on the goals of conservation, the identities of the plant community may be more important than the actual biodiversity of an island.  
Soil Effects. In this system, soil chemical characteristics do not seem to be influenced by grazing nor do they appear to affect the vegetation. Our results suggest that it is only the amount but not the chemical properties of soil that matter in this system. While N and P are normally limiting nutrients, it appears that they are not in our study. Rapid and pronounced losses of what are already shallow, erosion-prone soils result in sparse vegetation cover, short plants, and reduced vegetation biomass. We did detect a significant relationship between soil P and estimated arthropod species density. Kaspari et al. (2008) observed that P often tends to be the main limiting nutrient for decomposition in most ecosystems and fertilization experiments have shown that P addition stimulates cellulose-decomposing microbes resulting in greater arthropod biomass.  
Effects on Arthropods. We did not observe an effect of island grazing status on the characteristics of arthropod communities. This could be because our morphospecies distinction was not specific enough to see changes in family-level assemblages. Gardner et al. (1997) found that grazing creates a shift in species communities from Carabid species associated with shady, vegetated areas to Carabid species associated with more open areas. Woodcock et al. (2005) found that individual beetle guilds were differentially influenced by plant diversity and percent cover of grasses. General arthropod characteristics also appear unaffected by seabird densities, agreeing with research conducted by Orgeas et al. (2003) who determined that while neither arthropod species richness nor biomass were affected by yellow-legged gulls, instead, species composition itself was affected, including increases in Tenebrionid species. We also found that in the face of an increase in vegetation, arthropods remained at low levels, probably because all the benefits procured were passed on to the trophic level above them, lizards. When we divide arthropods into separate taxa, only a significant grazing effect was found for Dipterans where grazing increased the proportion found in the samples. Dipterans and all other flying insects are found at disproportionately low rates due to the nature of our pitfall traps and the windy conditions of the Aegean which could confound results (Woodcock 2005).  
Our observations of increasing estimated arthropod species density being associated with elevated soil P levels agree with parallel observations in the tropics (Sayer et al. 2010). We do not see grazing effects on arthropods because lizards are presumably continuously eating them and keeping them at constant levels.  
Effects of Seabirds. Seabirds drive these islet communities through bottom-up trophic interactions. Seabirds are thought to prefer nesting on smaller islands (Vidal et al. 2001), an observation that was confirmed in this study. Previous studies in the region (Pafilis et al. 2013) have detected a significant inverse correlation between seabird density and grazing. While we noticed a similar pattern in our study region, this relationship did not quite rise to significance. We also detected a significant increase in soil N and P levels with higher seabird densities. Allochthonous nutrient inputs from marine subsidies are critically important for these isolated terrestrial islands (Sánchez-Piñero & Polis 2000). These nutrients may support higher plant biomass and more nitrophilous plant species (Polis et al. 2002). However, these nutrients were only found to stimulate primary productivity during wet periods (Polis et al. 2002), which may explain why – given the generally arid conditions in the study region – we do not see an effect of soil nutrients on vegetation characteristics in our study.  
Seabirds can also reduce plant biomass by trampling and burrowing activities or by creating locally toxic conditions through extremely high nutrient levels (Hata et al. 2014). These negative effects may cancel out the positive effects in our study. Vidal et al. (1998) studied a Mediterranean archipelago near France and found that – especially on small islands – increasing yellow-legged gull densities allowed for proliferation of more non-native vegetation species. Seabirds can affect island arthropods in at least 2 ways – providing animal tissue including carcasses and food scraps for scavengers such as Tenebrionidae or Dermestidae beetles (Polis & Hurd 1996), or enhancing herbivorous or detritivorous arthropods through increased primary productivity (Anderson & Polis 1999). These bottom-up effects may then reverberate through the food web leading to increases in predatory spiders & lizards (Polis et al. 2002). Lastly, gulls can also act as important seed dispersers among islands, as large Pistacia lentiscus seeds were often found among the investigated guano.
