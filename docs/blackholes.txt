Quantum black holes as classical space factories
Space and matter may both be manifestations of a single fundamental quantum dynamics, as it may become evident during black-hole evaporation. Inspired by the fact that quantum electro- dynamics underlies the classical theory of elasticity, that in turn has a natural and well-known geometric description in terms of curvature and torsion, related to topological defects, here we move some necessary steps to find the map from such fundamental quantum level to the emergent level of classical space and quantum matter. We proceed by adapting the boson transformation method of standard quantum field theory to the quantum gravity fundamental scenario and successfully obtain the emergence of curvature and torsion, our main focus here. In doing so we have been able to overcome difficult issues of interpretation, related to the Goldstone modes for rotational symmetry. In fact, we have been able to apply the boson transformation method to disclinations, to relate them to the spin structure and to give an heuristic derivation of the matter field equation on curved space. We also improve results of previous work on the emergence of geometric tensors from elasticity theory, as the non-Abelian contributions to the torsion and curvature tensors, postulated in those papers, here emerge naturally. More work is necessary to identify the type of gravity theories one can obtain in this way.
The main goal of this paper is to offer general physical arguments and mathematical tools that govern the emergence of classical space as a collective manifestation of an underlying, largely unknown, quantum dynamics. In doing so, we have in mind black hole (BH) evaporation, where these fundamental quantum entities might realize this picture. Nonetheless, the general framework for emergence should remain valid in other settings. 
We take inspiration from the classical theory of elasticity, with its gravity-geometry tensors (metric, gij, curvature, Rijkl, torsion, Tijk), whose ultimate dynamical responsible is quantum electrodynamics (QED): a single quantum interaction at the “fundamental level” of the classical collective behavior. 
The second part of this program (from classical elasticity to gravity-geometry theory) is actually an old one, as already in the 1980s Kleinert  and in the 1990s Katanaev and Volovich  built-up correspondences between 3-dimensional geometry-gravity theories alla Cartan, gauge theories of ISO(3), and classical elasticity, especially in the presence of topological defects. Later this went beyond a simple mathematical tool to describe elastic phenomena and became a paradigm for fundamental physics on the emergence of space, known as “crystal gravity”. 
Although, of course, we do keep those results in mind and actually improve some of those derivations, our concern is the first part of the program, that is the general mechanism through which the quantum fundamental dynamics produces the classical emergent theory. The second step, from the classical emergent theory to specific types of gravity theories (e.g., General Relativity (GR), Teleparallel Gravity (TG), Conformal/Weyl Gravity (CG)) lies beyond the scope of this work. 
According to the quantum gravity (QG) framework we have in mind, both matter and space are emergent phenomena of a fundamental quantum dynamics of basic fermionic constituents that, with Feynman and Bekenstein, we call “Xons” (for a recent review see Ref. ). 
The low-energy theory of reference is a quantum field theory (QFT) living in some target space but both, the quantum matter and the classical space (i.e. the classical metric, torsion and curvature tensors), are emerging from the same dynamics. The final outcomes for matter and for space are different. Those Xons that bosonize, condense and form the lattice making space, whose approximate description is that of the classical continuum we experience at our scales. Those Xons that do not bosonize, make what we identify as “matter” at our scale1. There is a big conceptual difference, though, with the standard understanding of matter, because such particles should have properties that result from the interactions of the fundamental Xons with the lattice of the bosonized Xons, so they are, in fact, quasiparticles rather than elementary. That is why we call this QG picture the “quasiparticle picture”. 
In this QG context we shall use a powerful method that allows to obtain a (dynamical, Haag) map [12–16] from the Xons theory to the emergent (matter, space) Xons → (ψ, gµν) ,(1) where, for simplicity, we take ψ to be one kind of fermionic matter and gµν to be a classical space(time) metric. 
The method is inspired to the quasiparticle picture of Umezawa and collaborators, see, e.g., Refs.  and  mostly applied there to condensed matter systems, including the mentioned elasticity theory [17–19]. That method, though, takes as fundamental the QFT from which the higher level structures emerge. 
In our case, the fundamental level is discrete and its dynamics is actually unknown. Therefore, we need to cope with a certain amount of approximation, some given by the introduction of an Xonic field, Ψ(x) to describe the set Ψn, where the discrete label n is traded for the continuum label x, and Ψ is fermionic. Once that is assumed, the procedure can be applied and the goals accomplished. 
The key ingredients of Umezawa’s approach, that we apply here to a QG context, are • The dynamical map (or Haag expansion) that deals with all the emergent quantum excitations, like the quasi- particles. • The spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), within the underlying QFT, that produces the Nambu–Golstone (NG) bosonic collective excitations, that are phonons for Umezawa and here are quanta of space. • The SSB, in turn, through the boson transformation method [13, 14], gives raise to the classical collective excitations, necessary to build the theory of elasticity for Umezawa and the “theory of space” for us here. 
Indeed, the boson transformation method explains the formation of macroscopic objects in QFT by the condensation of a large number of bosonic particles in the vacuum. In particular, when the boson fields are gapless, as for NG fields, the method provides solutions of the field equations with topological defects. 
In the present work, we implement the boson transformation method to describe the dynamical emergence of a classical geometric structure (metric, curvature, torsion) from an underlying quantum dynamics on a structureless manifold (target space), and NG bosons condensation on vacuum. Let us summarize our approach in a scheme that, together with the schematic view of Fig.1, should help making clear our method and approximations. 
Before starting this journey, let us close this Introduction by putting into context the QG quasiparticle picture we just recalled. The modern approach to QG shifted from the quantization of gµν as a fundamental field, to the emergence paradigm. According to this, the gravitational field (hence spacetime itself) is a macroscopic or thermodynamics manifestation of the microscopic dynamics. Besides what mentioned, other perspectives are the corpuscular theory of BHs [20–22] or the SYK model, all strongly inspired by condensed matter physics. Another important line of this type of research is the approach based on the thermodynamics of spacetime, initiated by Jacobson [24–29], for which Einstein equations stem from a maximal entropy principle, δS = 0. Related, but independent, is the approach initiated by Verlinde [30, 31], that considers gravity as an entropic force. 
The paper is organized as follows. In Section II we recall the main points of the QG quasiparticle picture of Ref.  and propose a dictionary to adapt the formalism of the dynamical map to that picture. After a description of the boson method in Section III, in Section IV we study the SSB of E(3) symmetry, extending some issues discussed in Refs. [17–19] and applying them to the problem of space geometry and matter emergence from Xons dynamics. The last Section is devoted to our Conclusions. 
The fact that entropy of a local system could be bound may imply that the fundamental Hilbert space of such local system is finite-dimensional [33–35]. In this case the Hilbert space must describe all degrees of freedom (dof), that is those of matter and those of space. BHs are supposed to be the only physical systems which saturate such bounds. The last observation led to the quasiparticle picture of Ref., see also Refs. [2, 9, 11]. In that model, Xons indicate the fundamental building blocks whose interaction gives quantum matter and classical space. Their main features are: 1. Their Hilbert space is finite dimensional. 2. Xons forming a BH are free. 3. Their interaction is responsible for space and matter. 4. They are fermions, thus every quantum level can be filled by one mode at most.
In many respects, those features (with the exception, perhaps, of the second) are those of the quantum BH model of Refs. [36–38], see also the recent Ref.. The third point is the one at the basis of BH evaporation phenomenon [40, 41]: when Xons interact they add more space to the space outside the BH (reducing of the horizon area) and produce matter (Hawking radiation). Then evaporating BHs are “factories” of space and matter. In this paper we shall focus on the first “product”. 
With such picture in mind, in Ref.  the evolution of the entanglement entropy, between the emergent matter and the emergent space, during BH evaporation, was studied. There it was found that the final BH state has, in general, a nonzero entanglement entropy with the ordinary matter produced. Therefore, seen through the eyes of such ordinary matter, BH evaporation is a nonunitary process, or, in other words, the Page curve does not end at zero entanglement entropy. On the other hand, a unitary evolution is recovered when one analyzes the problem from the more fundamental perspective of the Xons, the elementary constituents of both matter and space. In the latter case, BH evaporation is described by the evolution of the quantum state where an (bn) are the environment (BH) fermionic ladder operators, acting on the Hilbert space HI (HII), so that an|0⟩I = bn|0⟩II = 0, = δnm. The parameter σ is not directly related to the physical time, nonetheless it plays the role of an evolution parameter of the BH evaporation, in the sense explained in Ref. : as Xons are supposed to be free in the BH phase, a way to keep track of the BH evolution is a counter that only sees those Xons that become interactive, that is precisely the job of σ. The maximal entanglement entropy between the modes “inside” and the modes “outside” the BH, Smax = Nln2, can be identified with the Bekenstein–Hawking entropy of the BH at σ = 0, and provides an entropy bound for the BH/radiation thermodynamic entropies. 
These considerations are fruitful in the quantum information analysis of BH evaporation, but the crucial question of how space and matter emerge from Xons, has not been investigated. Here we would like to take make the most of the powerful machinery of QFT recalled earlier. The problem is that QFT deals with systems with an infinite number of dof while, according to the previous arguments, the dof of a local system like a BH are, in fact, finite. Here comes our first approximation: if we only consider BHs of sizes much bigger that the Planck length, the Xons are so many, that a continuum is a good approximation. 
If with Ψn we indicate the fermionic dof of the Xons, i.e. an or bn, the first approximation is then Ψn ⇝ Ψ(x). (3) In other words, we deal with a quantum field depending on x that, in fact, is only a label that identifies the given mode. One way to think of this is that, given the finite set of modes, to swap Ψn → Ψm corresponds to x → x + s. Such permutation of the Ψs can be seen as a “translation” in the argument x. In the symmetric “phase”, given the indistinguishability of the Ψs, this translation is a symmetry. 
Let us stress here that this is indeed an approximation, and perhaps a wild one. We do not know what theory the fundamental dof obey, so we need to make some Ansatz and some approximations, guided by knowing where we have to end-up: quantum fields on classical curved spacetimes, both emerging from one single quantum dynamics. 
If we can live with that approximation, we have many advantages. First, we can proceed nearly as in a standard QFT in “flat space”. We have to recall, though, that this “flat space” coordinate, x, is only a formal label, counting where, in the set of Xons, that particular Xon is. Second, we can apply the methods of Refs. [13, 14] to let true space emerge, along with its geometric tensors, metric, curvature, tensor and with the quantum matter. 
FIG. 1. A schematic view of the method used in this paper to construct the classical space and its geometric tensor from the underlying quantum gravity. The method is inspired to Umezawa’s quasiparticle picture, 
based on the dynamical (Haag) map and on the boson transformation method in systems with SSB. We have to introduce a couple of approximations, though, the most important being the one that treats the discrete 
fundamental system as a quantum field Ψ(x).
We can now take a step further to say that our starting point is a fermion field Ψ(x) ≡ Ψ(σ, x) . (4) described by translationally symmetric equations. Such field is defined on R×R3, where σ ∈ R is the affine parameter above described and x ∈ R3. 
Actually, the emergence of the physical time-coordinate, with the associated metric structure, will not be discussed in this paper, for two reasons. First, we take the view that time is a measure of the evolution of the entropy at the fundamental level. When the entropy reaches a maximum, as it is supposed to be the case for BHs, then time stops. Henceforth, to obtain an emergent physical time requires the introduction of other ingredients in the quasiparticle picture, not available yet. One road could be Verlinde’s view of gravity as an entropic force. The second reason is that we shall obtain the metric (Vielbeine) and the (spin) connection, the key ingredients of the “theory of space”, by SSB of the appropriate symmetry. It is well known [42, 43] that the SSB of time translation (through which we should be getting the time components) is highly problematic. This as well indicates that for time a road different from that for space is necessary. 
As for the other labels, x, the space R3 is just an idealized space for those labels that, for a posteriori convenience, is taken to be three-dimensional and real, but by no means it is our physical space with its classical geometric description! The latter is what we want to see emerging from the underlying quantum theory of Ψ(σ, x). It is true that R3 has a metric structure, but that only means for us that we do have differential operators. We shall argue later that such flat (empty) spaces are, in fact, impossible (unphysical). The metric needs be always ea i ̸= δa i. 
As announced, within the general framework of the SSB of translations and rotations, in what follows we shall use the boson transformation method of Umezawa and collaborators [13, 14]. Such method explains the formation of macroscopic objects in QFT via the condensation in the vacuum of a large number of bosons. In particular, when the boson fields are gapless, as for NG modes of the SSB of some symmetry, the method permits to find solutions of the field equations with topological defects. Let us summarize the relevant features of this method, presenting it in a form suitable for our scopes.
Before doing so, it must be stressed, once more, that BH evaporation is the main motivation behind the present work. We tey to shed some light on the mechanism of matter and space formation, which was left to be explained in Refs.  and . However, the following considerations are general and could be relevant by themselves, with applications to other contexts, e.g. in condensed matter physics.
The dynamical map Let us consider an interacting quantum field Ψ, satisfying the equation Λ(∂) Ψ(x) = j[Ψ](x), (5) where Λ(∂) is a differential operator, while j is a functional of Ψ, describing the interaction. Eq.(5) can be formally rewritten as4 Ψ(x) = Ψ0(x) + � Λ−1 ⋆ j[Ψ] � (x) , Λ(∂)Ψ0(x) = 0 , (6) where Λ−1 ⋆ j is the convolution of the interacting terms with a Green function of the operator Λ. Notice that such Green’s function should be fixed by appropriate boundary conditions. Moreover Eq. (6) has to be regarded as a weak mapping, i.e. is not true at operator level, but is a relation among matrix elements, on some Hilbert space. The Hilbert space where such relation is defined cannot be established a priori and it depends on the physical situation one is going to describe. Ψ0 is sometimes called the physical field.
