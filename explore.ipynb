    "# Goats Versus Gravity - Exploring Embeddings\n",

    "## Introduction and Overview\n",
    "Vector embeddings are a numeric representation of something like text, images, sound, or really anything that has real-world meaning. The meaning of that object is \"captured\" within the numbers, but it is difficult for we mortal humans to understand numeric data...particuarly data that has hundreds or thousands or more dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to show you a common technique for making sense of high-dimension data, and crucically allowing you to see the relationships between data within that dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to use a technique called [t-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding) to visualize the relationships between the embeddings of four scientific papers. You will then create an interactive graph that can allow you to see the \"real data\" behind each data point, and compare the cosine similarity between any two points.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also learn how you can visualize your own text against this vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "These techniques should help you to gain a better understanding of how vector embeddings are useful to finding related data, and how you can use them to refine your application design and parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Papers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore some text embeddings of four scientific papers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [LIGO: The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.3041.pdf)\n",
    "2. [Livestock as a potential biological control agent for an invasive wetland plant](https://peerj.com/articles/567/)\n",
    "3. [Quantum black holes as classical space factories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15519)\n",
    "4. [Effects of Invasive Goats (Capra hircus) on Mediterranean Island Communities](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/117674)\n",
    "\n",
    "The title of the notebook should, at this point, be self-evident. We will be comparing two scientific papers about goats with two scientific papers about gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "These have been pre-processed, with the title and the next 31 paragraphs of each paper extracted. That text has been further processed to remove a number of references like `[3]`; the text therefore fairly \"clean\", and in concept each format is a semantic unit. You can view the raw text in the `data` directory (these are the `.txt` files).\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, OpenAI embeddings were computed using `text-embedding-ada-002`, and saved in a Pandas dataframe. This notebook will start from that point, but you are welcome to explore the data preparation by looking at [ingestion.ipynb](ingestion.ipynb)."

    "2. We can see two \"blocks\" of similiarity. The `goats` paper is at Index 0 to 31, and the `gravity` paper is at Index 32 to 63. We might expect that paragaphs in each paper would be more similar to each other, hence the more \"red\" hues on those corners.\n",
    "3. The two blocks of blue are one paper's paragraphs related to the other; that they are blue reflects a general dissimilarity. \n",
    "4. Paragraphs within the `goats` paper seem to be more similar to each other than the paragraphs in the `gravity` paper relate to each other. This is reflected in the more \"red\" hues in the `goats` block.\n",
    "5. In the `goats` paper, there is a cluster of similarity around Index 8-12.\n",
    "\n",

Specifically, these studies suggest that livestock can control<br>Phragmites when its cover is high and livestock are forced to graze in those areas (Fig. 4). For<br>example, when Phragmites is dominant and grazers are enclosed in these areas as in our experiment<br>and a 2-year study in New Jersey, USA that manipulated goats and sheep in small (0.8 ha),<br>un-replicated pens (Tesauro, 2002), livestock were effective at reducing Phragmites from∼100% to<br><50% cover. In contrast, when Phragmites is uncommon and livestock are free-roaming (i.e., grazers<br>not forced to eat Phragmites only), horses and deer in Maryland increased Phragmites abundance<br>relative to grazer exclusion plots (Sturm, 2007). Similarly, goats released into larger Phragmites<br>-invaded tidal marsh in New Jersey did not reduce Phragmites cover and consumed other marsh plants<br>to a greater degree (URS, 2005). These findings suggest that if livestock are released into mixed<br>marsh plant communities where alternative food choices are abundant (i.e., Phragmites is uncommon)<br>large grazers have the potential to facilitate Phragmites invasion, and thus be counterproductive to<br>management objectives. This conclusion is supported by our nutritional content study (Fig. 3) and<br>those of others (e.g., Vulink & Drost, 1991b) that indicate Phragmites has lower digestible matter<br>content (although higher protein content) than other common European salt marsh plants relative and<br>thus would not likely be preferred by grazers if given a choice.'],\n",

Our data suggest that<br>goats change plant community assemblages: they significantly decreased the height, percent cover,<br>and biomass of vegetation on an island. Additionally, goats significantly contribute to the<br>desertification of islands by initiating a long-term erosion cycle that delays recovery even once<br>goats have been removed.

Half of the documented<br>extinctions of Mediterranean island endemic species have occurred on small islands (Greuter 1995).<br>Many of the most detrimental island invasives are human associates, such as invasive rats (Rattus<br>spp.), feral cats (Felis catus), rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), and escaped livestock (Jones et<br>al. 2008; Nogales et al. 2004; Bowen & Van Vuren 1997). More specifically, introduced feral<br>livestock, such as pigs (Sus scrofa), sheep (Ovis aries), and goats (Capra hircus), tend to<br>overgraze and damage island landscapes, causing soil erosion, devastating the native plant<br>communities, and removing primary producers from island food webs (Coblentz 1978).'],\n",

Most plants have some sort of defense against herbivory (Marquis 1991) the extent<br>of which is often proportional to the risk of browsing (Rhoades 1979). Until the arrival of humans,<br>mammalian herbivores were absent from most small island ecosystems (Atkinson 1989). Due to the<br>energetic costs of resistance in plants, species that have evolved on islands in the absence of<br>grazing pressure often lack defenses against herbivory such as chemical deterrents, physical<br>weapons, or a tolerance to grazing (Carlquist 1974; Coblentz 1978; Vitousek 1988). The lack of<br>resistance traits can lead to strong shifts in the diet preferences of herbivores towards the less<br>defended endemic flora, giving more heavily defended invasive plants a competitive advantage (Loope<br>& Scowcroft 1985; Van Vuren & Coblentz 1987; Merlin & Juvik 1992). On New Zealand, Atkinson (2001)<br>discovered that some of the native plants did have defenses against herbivory believed to be caused<br>by associations with the extinct moa, a large flightless ratite. However, these defenses were only<br>partially effective against introduced mammalian herbivores (Atkinson & Greenwood 1989). In the<br>Mediterranean, plant species vary greatly in their levels of phenols; preferential grazing occurred<br>on species with the lowest phenolic levels (Massei et al. 2000).'],\n",

Domesticated in the dry highlands of western Iran<br>10,000 years ago (Zeder & Hesse 2000), goats are able to utilize many arid habitats unsuitable for<br>other herbivores. This adaptability arises from the combination of their slow metabolism, efficient<br>digestive system, low water requirements, high reproduction rates, and a generalist diet (Silanikove<br>2000).

Further, outside the goat<br>exclosures, there were fewer endemic species, more exotic species, and much more barren soil and<br>rock. Spatz & Mueller-Dombois (1973) found that the regeneration of the Hawaiian endemic koa tree<br>(Acacia koa), was interrupted in areas of grazing but abundant in goat exclosures. In the Galápagos,<br>goats have reduced or eliminated 77% of all plant species on the islands (Eckhardt 1972), and<br>compete with the native herbivore, the Galápagos tortoise (MacFarland et al. 1974). Consequently,<br>the decline of primary producers on islands with goat grazing constitutes a severe problem and<br>requires better understanding and management. Invasive goat numbers have been found in some studies<br>to be negatively correlated with seabird populations (e.g., Pafilis et al. 2013). Islands constitute<br>relatively closed terrestrial systems where local seabird populations provide critically important<br>allochthonous marine nutrient subsidies to the simple local food webs (Sánchez-Piñero & Polis 2000).<br>Seabirds leave guano, food scraps, and carrion on roosting and nesting sites. All of these serve as<br>fertilizers for plants, which in turn can boost arthropod and other primary consumer populations<br>(Sánchez-Piñero & Polis 2000). Indeed, nesting seabirds have been found to increase the limiting<br>soil nutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) (Wait et al. 2005), which in turn support dense<br>insular primary producer populations (Kolb et al. 2010). Thus, one aim of this study was to<br>investigate whether presence of goats is associated with decreased nesting seabird populations.<br>Given the importance of seabirds for nutrient cycling in island systems, any factor that reduces<br>their numbers can have impacts that go well beyond any immediate effects.'],\n",

Adequate<br>assessments of the consequences of eradication are hindered because ecological relationships among<br>island organisms are often poorly understood prior to eradication (Zavaleta et al. 2001). For<br>example, goat eradications on the Galápagos Islands led to a decline, rather than a recovery, of the<br>endangered Galápagos Hawk (Buteo galapagoensis), because the species had come to depend on<br>goat-altered habitats (Rivera-Parra et al. 2012). With declining Galápagos tortoise (Geochelone<br>elephantopus) populations and goat eradications, the lack of herbivores on Pinta Island actually led<br>to a decline in vegetation diversity through homogenization of the landscape (Hamann 1993).<br>Similarly, on the Bonin Islands, unbeknownst to conservation managers, goat grazing kept newly<br>arrived invasive plants under control. Once the goats were eradicated, these exotic plants overran<br>the landscape, devastating the native plant communities (Mack & Lonsdale 2002). Roxburgh et al.<br>(2004) discuss the “intermediate disturbance” hypothesis: the highest levels of biodiversity are<br>attained with intermediate levels of disturbance e.g., fire, natural disasters, and grazing. Up to a<br>point, grazing could allow less competitive, early successional species to coexist in the presence<br>of stronger competitors (Hobbs & Huenneke 1992). In the Mediterranean, foraging by goats has been an<br>important source of landscape heterogeneity, which allows for a mosaic of diverse habitats (San<br>Miguel-Ayanz et al. 2010; Gabay et al. 2008). The ecological role of grazing has been so extensive,<br>that many habitats are maintained by extensive livestock management systems (San Miguel-Ayanz et al.<br>2010). As a result, it has become obvious to the conservation community that in order to prevent<br>unintended consequences of eradications, it is critical to understand the effects and life history<br>traits of invasive goats before any eradication efforts are contemplated (Zavaleta et al. 2001).'],\n",

    "In building an application that searches based on embeddings, it is important to have an embedding model that gives good clustering of information. It is also important to understand what is the value for a cosine similarity that represents \"close\" and \"valid\". As you can see with this limited embedding space and simple embedding model, the cosine similarity scores that represent \"close\" are not as high as you might think they should be.\n",

    "Your specific application parameters are going to depend on some amount of experimentation and understanding of not only the embedding model, but also the input data you are using, and how you are splitting that data into semantic phrases. For example, if you blindly cut on word count boundaries, perhaps your embedding space will be more fragmented than if you are splitting on sentence, paragraph, section, or chapter boundaries. \n",
